          <h2>Sylvanus Otieno</h2>

          <p>
            I am a results-driven <strong>Data Analyst</strong> currently working at
            <strong>Secom World</strong>, where I apply data analysis techniques to
            support business operations and informed decision-making.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my current role, I work closely with <strong>business metrics</strong>
            including sales performance, customer behavior, product movement, and
            operational efficiency. I analyze data to identify trends, monitor
            performance, and provide insights that help improve strategy and overall
            business outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I regularly use tools such as <strong>Excel, SQL, Python, R, and Power BI</strong>
            for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting. My focus is on
            translating data into clear, practical insights that are easily understood
            by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through hands-on experience at Secom World, I continue to strengthen my
            understanding of data-driven business processes, performance measurement,
            and analytical problem-solving within a real-world commercial environment.
